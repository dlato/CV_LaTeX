abstract ={The importance of whole-genome multiplication (WGM) in plant evolution has long been recognized. In flowering plants, WGM is both ubiquitous and in many lineages cyclical, each round followed by substantial gene loss (fractionation). This process may be biased with respect to duplicated chromosomes, often with overexpression of genes in less fractionated relative to more fractionated regions. This bias is hypothesized to arise through downregulation of gene expression through silencing of local transposable elements (TEs). We assess differences in gene expression between duplicated regions of the paleopolyploid cotton genome and demonstrate that the rate of fractionation is negatively correlated with gene expression. We examine recent hypotheses regarding the source of fractionation bias and show that TE-mediated, positional downregulation is absent in the modern cotton genome, seemingly excluding this phenomenon as the primary driver of biased gene loss. Nevertheless, the paleo subgenomes of diploid cotton are still distinguishable with respect to TE content, targeting of 24-nt-small interfering RNAs and GC content, despite approximately 60 My of evolution. We propose that repeat content per se and differential recombination rates may drive biased fractionation following WGM. These data highlight the likely importance of ancient genomic fractionation biases in shaping modern crop genomes.},

   abstract = {Whole genome duplication (WGD) is widespread in flowering plants and is a driving force in angiosperm diversification. The redundancy introduced by WGD allows the evolution of novel gene interactions and functions, although the patterns and processes of diversification are poorly understood. We identified similar to 2,000 pairs of paralogous genes in Gossypium raimondii (cotton) resulting from an approximately 60 My old 5- to 6-fold ploidy increase. Gene expression analyses revealed that, in G. raimondii, 99.4% of the gene pairs exhibit differential expression in at least one of the three tissues (petal, leaf, and seed), with 93% to 94% exhibiting differential expression on a per-tissue basis. For 1,666 (85%) pairs, differential expression was observed in all tissues. These observations were mirrored in a time series of G. raimondii seed, and separately in leaf, petal, and seed of G. arboreum, indicating expression level diversification before species divergence. A generalized linear model revealed 92.4% of the paralog pairs exhibited expression divergence, withmost exhibiting significant gene and tissue interactions indicating complementary expression patterns in different tissues. These data indicate massive, near-complete expression level neo-and/or subfunctionalization among ancient gene duplicates, suggesting these processes are essential in their maintenance over similar to 60 Ma.},

   abstract = {Background: Tandemly arranged nuclear ribosomal {DNA} ({rDNA}), encoding 18S, 5.8S and 26S ribosomal {RNA} (rRNA), exhibit concerted evolution, a pattern thought to result from the homogenisation of rDNA arrays. However rDNA homogeneity at the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level has not been detailed in organisms with more than a few hundred copies of the rDNA unit. Here we study rDNA complexity in species with arrays consisting of thousands of units. Methods: We examined homogeneity of genic (18S) and non-coding internally transcribed spacer (ITS1) regions of rDNA using Roche 454 and/or Illumina platforms in four angiosperm species, Nicotiana sylvestris, N. tomentosiformis, N. otophora and N. kawakamii. We compared the data with Southern blot hybridisation revealing the structure of intergenic spacer (IGS) sequences and with the number and distribution of rDNA loci. Results and Conclusions: In all four species the intragenomic homogeneity of the 18S gene was high; a single ribotype makes up over 90% of the genes. However greater variation was observed in the ITS1 region, particularly in species with two or more rDNA loci, where >55% of rDNA units were a single ribotype, with the second most abundant variant accounted for >18% of units. IGS heterogeneity was high in all species. The increased number of ribotypes in ITS1 compared with 18S sequences may reflect rounds of incomplete homogenisation with strong selection for functional genic regions and relaxed selection on ITS1 variants. The relationship between the number of ITS1 ribotypes and the number of rDNA loci leads us to propose that rDNA evolution and complexity is influenced by locus number and/or amplification of orphaned rDNA units at new chromosomal locations.},

   abstract = {P>Allopolyploids represent natural experiments in which DNA sequences from different species are combined into a single nucleus and then coevolve, enabling us to follow the parental genomes, their interactions and evolution over time. Here, we examine the fate of satellite DNA over 5 million yr of divergence in plant genus Nicotiana (family Solanaceae). We isolated subtelomeric, tandemly repeated satellite DNA from Nicotiana diploid and allopolyploid species and analysed patterns of inheritance and divergence by sequence analysis, Southern blot hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). We observed that parental satellite sequences redistribute around the genome in allopolyploids of Nicotiana section Polydicliae, formed c. 1 million yr ago (Mya), and that new satellite repeats evolved and amplified in section Repandae, which was formed c. 5 Mya. In some cases that process involved the complete replacement of parental satellite sequences. The rate of satellite repeat replacement is faster than theoretical predictions assuming the mechanism involved is unequal recombination and crossing-over. Instead we propose that this mechanism occurs with the deletion of large chromatin blocks and reamplification, perhaps via rolling circle replication.},

   abstract = {Background The genus Spartina exhibits extensive hybridization and includes classic examples of recent speciation by allopolyploidy. In the UK there are two hexaploid species, S. maritima and S. alterniflora, as well as the homoploid hybrid S. x townsendii (2n = 60) and a derived allododecaploid S. anglica (2n = 120, 122, 124); the latter two are considered to have originated in Hythe, southern England at the end of the 19th century. Methods Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and flow cytometry were used to characterize the genomic composition and distribution of these species and their ploidy levels at Eling Marchwood and Hythe, both near Southampton, southern England. Key Results GISH identified approx. 60 chromosomes each of S. maritima and S. alterniflora origin in S. anglica and 62 chromosomes from S. alterniflora and 30 chromosomes from S. maritima in a nonaploid individual from Eling Marchwood, UK. GISH and flow cytometry also revealed that most (94%) individuals examined at Hythe were hexaploid (the remaining two individuals (6%) were dodedcaploid; n = 34), whereas hexaploid (approx. 36% of plants), nonaploid (approx. 27 %) and dodecaploid (approx. 36 %) individuals were found at Eling Marchwood (n 22). Conclusions Nonaploid individuals indicate the potential for introgression between hexaploid and dodecaploid species, complicating the picture of polyploid-induced speciation within the genus. Despite the aggressive ecological habit of S. anglica, it has not out-competed S. x townsendii at Hythe (homoploid hybrids at a frequency of 94 %, n = 34), despite > 100 years of coexistence. The success of GISH opens up the potential for future studies of polyploid-induced genome restructuring in this genus.},
